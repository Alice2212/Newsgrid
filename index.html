                New Galatasaray signing Wilfried Zaha has revealed that he spoke
                with Didier Drogba before moving to Turkey. The Ivory Coast
                winger surprised many fans when he rejected a contract offer
                from Crystal Palace this week.

                Speaking as a guest on the Just Chude podcast, she disclosed
                that she lost her father in April, 2023 after his battle with an
                illness. She noted that she initially thought it was an April
                fool's joke when she got the news. Detailing her childhood, she
                stated that she was closer to her mother than her father when
                she was growing up, but his illness brought them closer.
                According to her account, he fell ill around the time she
                emerged winner of Big Brother Naija in October 2019.

              Artificial intelligence is expected to pay off big for tech giants
              including Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) someday. But
              expect deeper investments before gains trickle to the bottom line,
              the companies said on Tuesday. Microsoft said costs rose sharply
              as it built new data centers to support AI and that capital
              expenditures will continue to rise as it buys chips from the likes
              of Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) to power those data centers.

              The Philippines made history at their first Women’s World Cup with
              their first goal and first win Tuesday, holding on under pressure
              to upset co-hosts New Zealand. The Football Ferns themselves had
              only five days earlier celebrated their first win ever in the
              tournament against former champions Norway. Sarina Bolden shocked
              the Wellington crowd with the match-winning goal in the 24th
              minute. This result leaves Norway bottom of the group after they
              were held to a frustrating draw by current group leaders
              Switzerland.

              Alibaba's (9988.HK) cloud computing division said it has become

              open-source artificial intelligence (AI) model Llama, allowing its
              Chinese business users to develop programs off the model. Meta
              released Llama2, a commercial version of Llama, this month to
              provide businesses a powerful free-of-charge alternative to pricey
              proprietary models sold by OpenAI and Google. At the time, Meta
              said its preferred partner for Llama2 was Microsoft (MSFT.O) but
              it would also be available through other partners.
