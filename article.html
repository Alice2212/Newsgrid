              Speaking as a guest on the Just Chude podcast, she disclosed that
              she lost her father in April, 2023 after his battle with an
              illness. She noted that she initially thought it was an April
              fool's joke when she got the news. Detailing her childhood, she
              stated that she was closer to her mother than her father when she
              was growing up, but his illness brought them closer. According to
              her account, he fell ill around the time she emerged winner of Big
              Brother Naija in October 2019.

              Mercy expressed her regret over the fact that she did not have a
              bond with him until it was too late. In her words, "I hate the
              fact that it's now coming the time that I wanted to show him that
              'your daughter has made it and accomplished something'. This was
              the time for him to enjoy himself but he became sick and couldn't
              do much, couldn't travel.
